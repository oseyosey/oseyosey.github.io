      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Junjie Oscar Yin My research is in natural language processing and machine learning.&#xA;I am a first-year PhD student at UW NLP, advised by Hannaneh Hajishirzi.&#xA;Previously, I was fortunate to collaborate with Sasha Rush.&#xA;In my undergraduate years at Johns Hopkins, I was grateful to be advised by Alan Yuille and supported by the Westgate Scholarship. During my studies, I spent a year at the University of Oxford, where I had the privilege of being mentored by Michael Wooldridge.</description>
